    Hi, my name is Alex King and I am the creator of Kingdom Apperance. I created this business because
    I wanted to be my own boss and I love to create new things and my brand is new and will only get
    better.This is all very new to me, but makeup is not found a love for makeup at a young age.My
    grandmother was a burn victum and she constantly struggled with feeling beautiful or pretty
    because of her scars and the way she looked all together. I wanted to help, but I didnt really know
    how. I found makeup and I was constantly practicing trying to get better and I am glad to say that I
    helped my grandmother with that, and from then on I knew I wanted to take it a step further, so I
    created KA. Now I partner with Motives Makeup company, and I'm glad they partnered with me. It's a chance
    to meet new faces and share my makeup ideas with them and they can make it happen.
